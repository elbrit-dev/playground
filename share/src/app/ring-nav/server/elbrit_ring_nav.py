# THE CALENDAR. A month's secondary is keyed in during the next month
# (July's trackers were all raised in August on production), due by
# ENTRY_DUE_DAY — for now the END OF THE MONTH: a due day past the month's
# last day is that last day (31 -> 28 Feb, 30 Sep, 31 Oct):
#   - the entry month is LAST month (`month` overrides it);
#   - the Secondary entry tile is on the strip from ENTRY_FROM_DAY to the
#     due day, its caption the due date, "30 Sep", while anything is left —
#     except for users whose Role Profile is "IT", who see it every day;
#   - the approval tile keeps the same window (IT always) and the same due
#     date as its caption while anything waits;
#     its "approved" counts that same month.
# `today` stands in for the server's date — to preview the strip on the 3rd.
#
# The Elbrit app's Ring Nav tiles for the CALLER, ready to draw: the app
# renders `items` as they come. READ-ONLY, and AS THE CALLER: every count
# is a frappe.get_list, so the ERP's own permissions decide what is counted
# — the same rows the caller sees on Secondary Entry and Secondary
# Approval. Nothing here decides who approves whom; no raw SQL.
#
# Answer:
#   { "user", "seat", "month", "items": [ <tile>, ... ] }
# A tile is Ring Nav's item: { id, label, href, icon, statusIcon,
#   statusTone, count, caption, captionTone, segments: [{ key, value,
#   tone, label }] }. Entry tiles first, then approval tiles. More tasks
#   (support, service...) are more tiles.
#
# TWO TASKS, the same rules (TASKS below): SECONDARY (Secondary Data Entry,
# per stockist) and DOCTOR SUPPORT (Doctor Support, per doctor). Each gets an
# entry tile and an approval tile as described here for Secondary.
#
# SECONDARY ENTRY — every entry the caller may see for the entry month (the
# "Secondary Data Entry Permission Query" decides), each in ONE bucket for
# the caller's seat (their active Employee's role_id). Within an entry only
# the seat's lines count — an entry carries several seats' lines:
#   approved  its approval row says "... Approved and Waiting for
#             Verification" or verified — green at once, MIS verifying is
#             not waited for — whatever its lines say
#   rejected  its approval row says Rejected — back to the BE (likewise)
#   draft     otherwise: none of the seat's lines yet, or any still Draft
#   waiting   otherwise: all out of Draft, "... Approval Waiting" (or no
#             row yet)
# A decided approval (approved / rejected) wins over Draft lines: it proves
# the seat submitted.
# The approval's state is read from the entry's status rows: a BE cannot
# read their own trackers.
#
# NO SEAT, IT ROLE PROFILE — an OVERVIEW instead: every stockist x seat
# across the entries they may see, bucketed the same way (a seat's lines on
# an entry are one unit, as one approval; an entry with no lines at all is
# one draft unit). Anyone else without a seat gets no entry tile.
#
# SECONDARY APPROVAL — ONLY for someone with work waiting on them, in the
# entry window: a Secondary tracker in "... Approval Waiting" whose
# next_approver is the caller (any month — old work is still work). No
# queue, no tile: a BE, or an approver who is clear, gets none.
#   waiting   those trackers
#   approved  the Secondary trackers the caller can see (the "Operational
#             Tracker Restriction" permission query decides) approved, whose
#             ENTRY is of the month by its own `date` field (not the names)
#             — from "Waiting for Verification" on; "... Verification
#             Rejected" is not
# The IT role profile ALWAYS gets it, as an overview: every Secondary
# tracker they can see that waits, and the month's approved.
#
# safe_exec: no import, no .format(), no set literals, no tuple
# unpacking, no underscore-prefixed names.
