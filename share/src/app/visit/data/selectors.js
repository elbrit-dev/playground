 * every call in the region -- hundreds of rows belonging to people the reader
 * would have to scroll past to find their own. Worse, it presented a report's
 * solo call as though the manager had made it; the manager's name was in the
 * title and the rep's was buried in the subtitle.
 *
 * A visit is this member's when they are ON THE PARTICIPANT TABLE. A manager
 * therefore sees exactly the joint calls they actually attended, and a rep
 * sees their own. The tree row above still shows the rolled-up ratio -- that
 * is a team fact and stays one; this is the personal half of it.
 *
 * FALLS BACK TO employeeId WHEN participantId IS NULL. Participants resolve
 * through the roster by login email, and an unresolved one (an ops account,
 * someone inactive, a schema that does not return reference_docname) would
 * otherwise empty every plan on the screen at once. Falling back to whose
 * plan it is reproduces the old behaviour for exactly the rows that cannot
 * answer the new question.
 *
 * POB is a separate doctype joined on (rep, doctor, day) -- see shape.js for
 * why that join is ASSUMED rather than verified. Summed, not first-wins: one
 * call can carry more than one quotation. The same rep visiting the same
 * doctor twice in a day would show the day's total against both rows; that
 * is the known limit of a join with no visit reference on it, and it is
 * still better than dropping the money from the row entirely.
 *
 * The money stays keyed on the ROW's employeeId rather than the reader's:
 * a quotation belongs to the rep who raised it, so a manager opening a joint
 * call still sees the POB that call produced.
