/* The contract between the data source and everything above it.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE SEAM. Today `useVisitKpi` fills these shapes from
 * `mockData.js`; tomorrow it fills them from the ERPNext GraphQL endpoint.
 * Nothing else in the feature may know which of the two it got — no component
 * imports mockData, and no component reads a `custom_*` field name.
 *
 * A VisitRow is ONE PLANNED VISIT, already joined. On the wire it arrives as
 * an Event with a nested `event_participants` array; the row below is the
 * flattened form:
 *
 *   Event.name                              -> eventId
 *   Event.starts_on                         -> plannedDate   (date only; the
 *                                              doctype has all_day = 1, so
 *                                              there is never a time here)
 *   Event.custom_employee_id__name          -> employeeId
 *   Event.custom_doctor__name               -> doctorId
 *
 * The two NAME fields are not on the Event at all. A link field's `name` is
 * the linked record's primary key -- "E01102", "DR-60005" -- so both had to
 * be resolved from the linked doctype: `employeeName` against the roster
 * this screen already fetches, `doctorName` from the Lead's own `lead_name`.
 * See liveSource.js; printing a key where a name belongs is the bug this
 * note exists to stop coming back.
 *   Event.custom_hq__name                   -> hq
 *   Event.custom_pob_given                  -> pobGiven
 *   participant.custom_visit_time           -> visitTime     (null = not done)
 *   participant.custom_distance             -> distanceKm
 *   participant.custom_is_force_visit       -> forceVisit
 *   participant.custom_force_visit_reason   -> forceVisitReason ('' = none)
 *
 * `eventId` IS NOT A ROW KEY. An Event carries an array of participants and
 * this row is the flattened form, so one Event with two participants is two
 * rows sharing an eventId. Anything that needs to identify a row uniquely --
 * a React key, a map -- has to add something to it; see doctorPlan().
 *
 * The two derived facts the whole screen rests on:
 *   PLANNED  = the row exists
 *   HAPPENED = row.visitTime != null
 *
 * @typedef {Object} VisitRow
 * @property {string}      eventId
 * @property {string}      subject
 * @property {string}      plannedDate   'YYYY-MM-DD'
 * @property {string}      employeeId
 * @property {string}      employeeName
 * @property {string}      doctorId
 * @property {string}      doctorName
 * @property {string}      hq
 * @property {string}      department
 * @property {boolean}     pobGiven
 * @property {string|null} visitTime     'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss', or null
 * @property {number|null} distanceKm
 * @property {boolean}     forceVisit
 * @property {string}      forceVisitReason  free text, '' when none was given
 *
 * A TeamMember is one node of the reporting hierarchy. `reportsTo` is
 * Employee.reports_to; `designation` is the raw ERPNext designation, which is
 * why DESIGNATION_SHORT exists rather than the abbreviations being stored.
 *
 * `vacant` has no ERPNext FIELD behind it -- see PLAN.md §2.6 and
 * liveSource.js's isVacantId -- it is inferred from the "V..." employee ID
 * naming series HR uses for a placeholder record on an open seat. It is
 * carried on the member so the rule lives in ONE place (the data source)
 * rather than being re-derived by every consumer.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} TeamMember
 * @property {string}      id
 * @property {string}      name
 * @property {string}      designation
 * @property {string|null} reportsTo
 * @property {string}      hq
 * @property {boolean}     vacant
 * @property {boolean}     onLeave
 * @property {string|null} userId   Employee.user_id -- the login this person
 *                                  is, used only to match a Quotation's
 *                                  `owner` back to a TeamMember (see
 *                                  PobEntry below); nothing else reads it.
 *
 * A PobEntry is one real order attributed to one visit-day's POB (Personal
 * Order Booking) figure -- money, not the `custom_pob_given` checkbox
 * `pobGiven` above reads. ASSUMED, NOT YET VERIFIED against real ERP data:
 * neither available API token could see a Lead-targeted Quotation to confirm
 * this directly (Quotation is permission-scoped the same way Event is — see
 * conversation history). Modelled on:
 *
 *   Quotation.quotation_to = 'Lead'      -- the doctor is a CRM Lead, not a
 *                                           Customer, on this instance
 *   Quotation.party_name                 -> doctorId   (matches
 *                                           VisitRow.doctorId, e.g. "DR-18854")
 *   Quotation.owner                      -> resolved to employeeId via
 *                                           TeamMember.userId (the "created
 *                                           by" sales contributor)
 *   Quotation.grand_total (or .total)    -> amount
 *   Quotation.transaction_date           -> plannedDate
 *
 * `employeeId` and `plannedDate` are named to match VisitRow on purpose, not
 * because a PobEntry IS a visit -- it lets `forEmployees`/`inPeriod` scope
 * both without a second copy of that filtering. If this join turns out wrong
 * once verified, the fix is isolated to fetchPobQuotations in liveSource.js;
 * nothing downstream (pobTotal, KpiGrid) cares how the number was produced.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} PobEntry
 * @property {string} employeeId
 * @property {string} doctorId
 * @property {number} amount
 * @property {string} plannedDate  'YYYY-MM-DD'
