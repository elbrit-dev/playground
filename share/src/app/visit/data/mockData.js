/* Mock dataset for the Team Report screen.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND NOT A HARDCODED SET OF NUMBERS
 * The reference dashboard this screen is modelled on hardcodes its totals, so
 * its cards cannot disagree with its tree — and cannot be wrong either. Here
 * the numbers are COMPUTED from rows by the same selectors the live data will
 * run through, so the mock exercises the real aggregation path. If
 * `visitsByHour` has an off-by-one, this mock will show it.
 *
 * DETERMINISM
 * A seeded LCG, not Math.random. Two calls with the same anchor date produce
 * byte-identical rows, which is what makes a Playwright screenshot baseline
 * possible at all. Never introduce Date.now() or Math.random() below.
 *
 * FIDELITY TO THE REAL DATA
 * Names, HQs, departments and the BE/ABM/RBM/SM ladder are taken from the live
 * ERPNext instance (see PLAN.md §2). Volumes are tuned to the real
 * distribution: ~12 planned calls per BE per day, ~70% completion by 4pm,
 * ~10% force visits, ~60% POB given.
