 * ON -- see doctorPlan -- so a rep sees their own day and a manager sees the
 * joint calls they actually attended, not a scroll of their reports' work
 * filed under their own name.
 *
 * EACH CALL EXPANDS TO ITS PARTICIPANTS, with each attendee's own arrival time
 * and their own geo-verified/force status. On the single-participant events
 * the live data actually holds that is one line; on a joint call it is the
 * only place the two people's outcomes can differ visibly.
 *
 * Capped, sorted completed-first, so the sixty shown are the sixty that
 * happened. The cap counts CALLS, not attendees: sixty rows is a scroll
 * budget, and a joint call is one row.
 *
 * ONE OPEN AT A TIME. The sheet is a phone-height scroll container; letting
 * every group stay open turns it into the flat list this replaced, and the
 * reader loses the doctor-per-line shape that makes it skimmable. */
