/* The 2x2 headline grid.
 *
 * THE THIRD CARD IS MONEY, as the reference always intended ("POB COLLECTED
 * ₹1.8 L · ₹899/call") -- it just took finding the real source first.
 * `Event.custom_pob_given` is only a checkbox (PLAN.md §2.5); the actual
 * rupee figure comes from `Quotation` (`quotation_to = 'Lead'`, since a
 * doctor is a CRM Lead here), summed and attributed to the visiting rep via
 * `owner`. See shape.js's PobEntry for the full join and its ASSUMED,
 * NOT-YET-VERIFIED status -- neither available API token could see one of
 * these quotations to confirm it directly. `pobAmount`/`pobPerCall` arrive
 * pre-computed (selectors.js's pobTotal) rather than a `{given, of}` pair,
 * because there is nothing left for this component to compute once the
 * number is real money instead of a ratio.
 *
 * `periodSuffix` is the word the two period-scoped labels end with --
 * 'today', 'MTD' or 'Aug'. A string and not the period id, because the
 * card cannot work it out on its own once a past month is selectable: it
 * would need the month AND the dataset's today to tell 'MTD' from 'Aug',
 * and that is the page's knowledge, not a metric card's.
 *
 * `callStandard` is the company's per-day call target. It is a business
 * constant, not data, which is why it arrives as a prop rather than being
 * derived — and why the tone flips on it rather than on an arbitrary
 * percentile. */
