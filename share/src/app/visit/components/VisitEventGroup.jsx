/* One CALL, with the people who made it underneath.
 *
 * The header is the doctor — one line per call, not per attendee, so a joint
 * visit stops reading as the same doctor listed twice for no stated reason.
 * Expanding it names each participant with their OWN arrival time and their
 * own geo-verified/force status, because that is the half of a joint call
 * that genuinely differs between the two people standing in it.
 *
 * ALWAYS EXPANDABLE, even at one participant. Every Doctor Visit plan event
 * in the live data carries exactly one, so a caret that appeared only on the
 * rare joint call would be a control most readers never meet and would not
 * recognise when they did. A uniform row is worth more than a saved tap.
 *
 * The group tone is optimistic — red only when EVERY attendee forced it (see
 * groupByEvent). A mixed call says so in words instead, because "1 of 2
 * forced" is the fact, and flattening it to a colour would either accuse the
 * rep of the manager's shortcut or hide the manager's entirely. */
