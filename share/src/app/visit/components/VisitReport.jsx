/* The report itself. Everything the page shows lives here; the route around it
   only supplies a width.
 *
 * CONTAINER QUERIES, NOT MEDIA QUERIES — `@2xl/report:` and `@5xl/report:`
 * rather than `sm:` and `lg:`. This is the change that lets the width control
 * on /visit work at all: a media query reads the VIEWPORT, so a 390px wrapper
 * in a 1440px window would still match `lg:grid-cols-3` and the resizer would
 * change nothing but the crop. A container query reads the nearest named
 * container, which is the wrapper.
 *
 * It is also the more honest description of the layout. Nothing here cares how
 * big the window is; it cares how much room it has been given. That makes the
 * report droppable into a narrow column or a drawer without a rewrite.
 *
 * The thresholds are the stock container scale — @2xl is 672px and @5xl is
 * 1024px — chosen over arbitrary values so they stay tokens. They sit close to
 * the `sm` (640) and `lg` (1024) they replaced.
 *
 * The page owns exactly five pieces of state — the scope picks, period,
 * month, selected HQ, and which drill-down sheet is open — and derives
 * everything else, so the cards, the chart and the tree cannot disagree:
 * there is one set of rows, filtered once.
 *
 * THE SCOPE PICKER CARRIES THE WHOLE QUESTION: which people, at what
 * depth, however many branches. `picks` is an array of
 * `{ id, includeSubtree }` and everything the report shows is the UNION of
 * those branches — ids into a Set, so picking a manager and one of their
 * own reports counts that report once rather than twice.
 *
 * THE HOOK IS NEVER TOLD ABOUT THE PICKS, and this reads from its
 * UNSCOPED output (`allTeam`/`allRows`) rather than its scoped one. Two
 * reasons: a union of four branches is not a subtree, so there is no
 * single id the hook could have been given — and narrowing from a
 * pre-scoped pool silently drops any pick that falls outside it. That
 * second one is not hypothetical: with a non-manager viewer the picker
 * offers company roots while the hook scopes to that one person, so every
 * pick was being discarded and the control looked dead.
 *
 * The permission boundary lives in ScopeSelect, which decides what may be
 * offered at all. It is not this narrowing's job, and making it both was
 * what coupled them.
 *
 * This replaced a Team Report / My Report dropdown, which could only ever
 * mean "the scoped person, or the scoped person alone" and had to be kept
 * in step with the picker beside it by hand.
 *
 * Reporting on one person rather than a team hides the two pieces that are
 * ABOUT a team and say nothing about an individual: who is in the field
 * today, and the "reps active" clause on the HQ detail. A roster card
 * reading "1 of 1 in field" is not an answer anyone needed.
 *
 * `monthRange` is the odd one out: every other piece of state re-slices
 * data already in hand, but the dataset only covers the months asked for,
 * so changing it refetches (see useVisitKpi). It is held here rather than
 * inside PeriodTabs because the header, the KPI labels and the doctor-plan
 * sheet all have to say WHICH months, and a picker owning the value
 * privately would leave three places guessing.
 *
 * It is kept as the picker's own [Date, Date] and converted to 'YYYY-MM'
 * on the way down, rather than stored as strings and rebuilt as Dates on
 * the way back up. Round-tripping a Date through a month string and back
 * is where a timezone bug gets in, and the picker is the only thing here
 * that wants Dates at all.
 *
 * THE SHEETS LIVE HERE, not in the components that open them. One `sheet`
 * value means two cannot be open at once, and a sheet opened from the
 * attendance card reads the same `todayRows` the card counted — a card that
 * owned its own sheet would be free to fetch or filter its own copy, which
 * is the one way a drill-down can contradict the number it came from.
 *
 * `data-surface="app"` puts the column on the field-app density scale (22px
 * controls, 12px body) rather than the console's. Everything inside reads that
 * from the tokens; no component takes a `size` prop for it. */
