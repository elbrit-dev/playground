/* PrimeReact Paginator — design-system PassThrough preset.
 *
 * Extracted from dataTablePreset.js, where these sections lived because a
 * DataTable renders a Paginator as a child and styles it through its own `pt`.
 * They are here now because there is also a STANDALONE <Paginator> — in
 * DataTableNew.jsx, outside any DataTable — and that one was still lara-themed.
 * It was also the largest remaining block in globals.css at 21 rules.
 *
 * Both cases use this one object:
 *   - nested   — dataTablePreset re-exports it under its `paginator` section,
 *                and `unstyled` propagates from the DataTable to its children.
 *   - standalone — registered globally in registry.js, with `unstyled` set at
 *                the call site.
 *
 * The `context` keys used below (`active`, `selected`) are the two that ARE
 * populated for this component; verified in the DOM, not assumed. See
 * docs/PRIMEREACT_SWEEP.md landmine 2 for why that matters.
