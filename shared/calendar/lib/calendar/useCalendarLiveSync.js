/**
 * Keeps the calendar in step with ERP without the user having to press Sync.
 *
 * Two triggers:
 *  - writes from this browser (any tab) refetch immediately, so a leave the
 *    manager just approved is reconciled against what ERP actually stored;
 *  - a cheap aggregate probe every `intervalMs` catches writes made by *other*
 *    users, which the browser has no other way of hearing about.
 *
 * Probing pauses while the tab is hidden and resumes — with an immediate
 * check — on focus, visibility change and reconnect, so a phone that was in a
 * pocket is up to date by the time it is looked at.
 *
 * @param {{ refresh: () => Promise<unknown>, enabled?: boolean, intervalMs?: number }} options
 *   refresh must bypass caches (see `reloadEvents` in the calendar context).
