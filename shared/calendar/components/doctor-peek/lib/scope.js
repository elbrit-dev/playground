/**
 * WHAT THIS VIEWER IS ALLOWED TO COUNT.
 *
 * Every fact this page shows about a doctor is stamped with a ROLE PROFILE —
 * the seat that produced it, not the person:
 *
 *   support   `Support Items.custom_role_profile`      (+ custom_department / custom_hq)
 *   visits    `Event Participants.custom_role_profile` (+ the Event's own custom_*)
 *   service   `Doctor Service.department` / `.hq`      (role_profile is OFTEN EMPTY)
 *   POB       nothing of its own — INHERITED from its visit, see below
 *
 * POB IS THE ODD ONE. A Quotation carries no seat, no employee and no
 * department; `Quotation Item`'s only custom fields are GST columns. Its one
 * honest link is `custom_event` -> the doctor visit -> that visit's seat, and
 * every doctor-linked Quotation in ERP does carry it. So a POB is scoped by the
 * visit it was raised on, never by `owner` — owner is routinely an admin or an
 * integration account and says nothing about whose call it was.
 *
 * The attributed order lines on `Sales Order Item` are deliberately NOT read
 * here. They carry doctor, seat, department and HQ and would be the easier
 * source, but order and invoice documents are out of bounds for this page.
 *
 * A POB raised straight from the doctor page has no event at all and stays
 * unattributed — it reaches nobody once scoping is on. That is a gap in the
 * capture flow, not something to paper over by showing it to everyone.
 *
 * A doctor is routinely covered by several seats across several divisions —
 * DR-6879 is worked by BE5-ELBR-MY-MAN (Elbrit Mysore) AND BE7-AURA-KA-MAN
 * (Aura & Proxima Karnataka), both out of HQ-Mangalore. Showing a reader the
 * whole row set would hand an Elbrit Mysore BE the Aura numbers for the same
 * doctor. So the page counts only the rows whose seat falls inside the
 * reader's own span of control.
 *
 * ONE RULE COVERS EVERY GRADE. The span is the reader's own subtree in the
 * reporting hierarchy, and every grade's stated rule falls out of it:
 *
 *   BE    subtree is just them            -> their one HQ
 *   ABM   subtree is their BEs            -> the HQs THEY hold, not the
 *                                            division's whole HQ list
 *   RBM   subtree is their ABMs + BEs     -> their division
 *   SM    subtree is their RBMs downward  -> every division under them, which
 *   ZSM                                      is 1, 2 or 3 of them, never the
 *                                            ones they do not carry
 *
 * There is no per-grade branch anywhere below. Adding one is how the rules
 * drift apart.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ WHY THE
 * TREE IS WALKED ON `Employee.reports_to` AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVES
 *
 * Three other routes look right in ERP and are all wrong:
 *
 *   `Employee.lft`/`rgt`   — the nested set is STALE. E00494 (RBM-CND-CH-CHE)
 *     sits at 184..243 while the manager it reports to, E00006, sits at
 *     189..332; E01053 reports to the same manager from 685..720. A containment
 *     test on those numbers silently returns the wrong people, which is the
 *     worst possible failure for a permission boundary.
 *
 *   `Role Profile.lft`/`rgt` — never maintained at all; every row reads 0/0.
 *
 *   `Role Profile.custom_employee_id` — the seat's back-link to its holder goes
 *     stale on transfer. RBM-AURA-KA-MYS carries NULL for both its employee and
 *     its department, while Employee E01283 correctly names that seat and
 *     carries the department. Read the seat and you lose a whole region; read
 *     the Employee and you do not.
 *
 * `reports_to` is the one link maintained on every move, so it is the only one
 * trusted here. `Role Profile.parent_role_profile` agrees with it and is used
 * ONLY to fill gaps.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ WHY THE
 * DEPARTMENT COMES OFF THE SUBTREE AND NEVER OFF THE READER'S OWN ROW
 *
 * An SM or ZSM has `department = "Sales - ELPL"` on their Employee row and
 * `custom_department = null` on their Role Profile. "Sales - ELPL" is a holding
 * bucket, not a division — filtering by it matches nothing. Their real
 * divisions are only discoverable from the RBMs beneath them: E00010's seat is
 * SM-ELB_AURA_KA, and the four RBMs under it name Elbrit Coimbatore, Elbrit
 * Trichy, Elbrit Chennai and Aura & Proxima Karnataka. That is the correction
 * this module exists to make.
 *
 * Vacant seats (`V…` employee ids) are deliberately KEPT. Doctor Service rows
 * are written against them — `by: "V02016"` — so dropping them loses real
 * spend.
 *
 * Left staff are not walked, and do not need to be: their rows are stamped with
 * the SEAT, and the seat is still held by whoever replaced them. Filtering on
 * role profile rather than on employee is what makes a predecessor's POB still
 * count for the person sitting in that chair today.
