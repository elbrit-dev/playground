/**
 * Every ERP read the doctor detail makes, as ONE plain async function over a
 * GraphQL connection (see source.js).
 *
 * Two waves, as before. Wave one is the org (who is reading, and everyone under
 * them) alongside the six doctor reads, all fired together. Wave two is purely
 * local now: the rows are narrowed to the reader's span and the visit rows'
 * employee ids are turned into roles and departments from the org already in
 * hand — no second trip to ERP.
 *
 * Every read fails ON ITS OWN. A refused or broken read empties its own panel
 * and names itself in `errors` / `denied`; it never takes the rest of the page
 * with it. Only a missing connection is fatal.
 *
 * Nothing is bounded by the selected period: the chart's window is the last
 * twelve months of anything on record, and a doctor's whole history is a few
 * hundred rows at the outside, so it is read whole and filtered in the browser.
