 * Every number the doctor console draws, as ONE pure function.

 * chosen, and returns the finished figures — the totals cards, the coverage
 * rings, the chart series, the department table, the activity feed, the filter
 * label. No fetching, no React, no state.
 *
 * It is a plain function and not a hook for one reason: the five cards are
 * placed SEPARATELY on a page, and the single filter (department, period, value
 * format) only means anything if one thing owns the arithmetic. The session
 * runs this once per change and hands every card the same object, so two cards
 * can never be measured over different windows — which is exactly what would
 * happen if each derived its own.
 *
 * `compact` is deliberately NOT an input. Each card measures its own box now,
 * so anything that depends on width (the chart's label step) is computed by the
 * card that draws it, not here.

   * The division is tested against the DOCTOR's own divisions, not merely
   * against "is it set". A visit's div comes from the employee record, and at
   * the top of the ladder that is an HR bucket rather than a sales division:

   * parseDepartment turns into a division named "Sales" that no doctor has. It
   * passed an "is it set" test and was counted in the headline, but the table's
   * rows are the doctor's divisions, so it landed in none of them and the two
   * disagreed by one all over again. Testing against the doctor's own list is
   * what makes the headline equal the sum of the table's rows BY CONSTRUCTION,
   * for every doctor, rather than for the ones we happened to check.
